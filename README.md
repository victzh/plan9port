This is my patched version of the port of many Plan 9 libraries and programs to
Unix.

See https://github.com/9fans/plan9port/compare/master...sminez:master for
details of the current diff from the main repo.

Modifications
-------------

- Added custom color scheme via config.h
- Default font is Terminess Nerd Font
- Up and down arrow keys move the cursor, not scroll the page
- `Tabexpand` command for converting `\t` to spaces (controlled by tabstop)
- Don't show dot-files in directory listings


Bindings
--------

Further bindings need to be defined in the switch statement beginning
src/cmd/acme/text.c:687

- Ctrl
  - c: copy
  - x: cut
  - v: paste
  - z: undo
  - r: redo
  - s: save
  - e: move to end of line
  - a: move to begining of line
  - f: filename completion
  - u: kill line
  - w: kill word (backwords)

Installation
------------

To install, run ./INSTALL.  It builds mk and then uses mk to
run the rest of the installation.  

For more details, see install(1), at install.txt in this directory
and at https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/man1/install.html.

Documentation
-------------

See https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/ for more documentation.
(Documentation is also in this tree, but you need to run
a successful install first.  After that, "9 man 1 intro".)

Intro(1) contains a list of man pages that describe new features
or differences from Plan 9.

Helping out
-----------

If you'd like to help out, great!  The TODO file contains a small list.

If you port this code to other architectures, please share your changes
so others can benefit.

Git
---

You can use Git to keep your local copy up-to-date as we make 
changes and fix bugs.  See the git(1) man page here ("9 man git")
for details on using Git.
